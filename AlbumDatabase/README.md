# ALBUM DATABASE
A simple database that helps a music store track inventory changes (eg. stock albums for sale- ADD, sell an album - REMOVE). This program also ***processes past transaction files*** and store those data a tidy list so for example a new manager could benefit a lot from their predecessor's database. A great feature of this database is its ***interactive inteface*** that allow the store to perform certain functions: LIST all currently available album, ADD an album in a specific format, REMOVE an album by inputting the order number (eg. 1 for the 1st album), QUIT the program.
