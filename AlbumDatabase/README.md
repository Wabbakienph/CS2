# ALBUM DATABASE
A simple database that helps a music store track inventory changes (eg. stock albums for sale- ADD, sell an album - REMOVE). A great feature of this database is its ***[interactive inteface](AlbumDatabase/ArrayListDB.java)*** that allow the store to perform certain functions: LIST all currently available album, ADD an album in a specific format, REMOVE an album by inputting the order number (eg. 1 for the 1st album), QUIT the program. This program also ***processes past transaction files*** and store those data a tidy list so for example a new manager could benefit a lot from not having to manually type all of their predecessor's data to the UI.
